COVERAGE ANALYSIS: WHY HIGH COVERAGE IS IMPOSSIBLE

This document calculates the maximum possible coverage for both scenarios.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO 1 (Small Scale)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ONE SENSOR (60 degree FoV)
   Range: 18 meters
   Angle: 60 degrees (1/6 of a circle)
   Area Covered: 170 square meters

2. ALL 5 SENSORS
   Total Coverage = 5 * 170 = 850 square meters

3. THE MAP
   Size: 60m x 60m (3x3 Grid)
   Total Area = 3,600 square meters

4. THE RESULT
   Maximum Coverage = 850 / 3,600
   Maximum Coverage = 23.6%

EXPLANATION:
In this small map, 5 sensors are simply not enough to cover the floor spacing. 
Even if they spread out perfectly, over 76% of the 3x3 grid remains blind spots. 
The targets can easily hide in these large gaps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO 2 (Large Scale)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ONE SENSOR (60 degree FoV)
   Area Covered: 170 square meters (Same as above)

2. ALL 50 SENSORS
   Total Coverage = 50 * 170 = 8,500 square meters

3. THE MAP
   Size: 200m x 200m (10x10 Grid)
   Total Area = 40,000 square meters

4. THE RESULT
   Maximum Coverage = 8,500 / 40,000
   Maximum Coverage = 21.2%

EXPLANATION:
The 10x10 map is physically too massive for 50 sensors.
 The sensors are small and short-ranged compared to the huge environment. 
 Almost 80% of the map is permanently dark, making it mathematically impossible to track most targets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If the Field of View (FoV) is reduced from 60 degrees to 45 degrees, 
the performance gets significantly worse.

- 60 degrees = 21-23% Max Coverage
- 45 degrees = 15-17% Max Coverage

Reducing the angle makes the sensors "blind" to an even larger portion of the map, 
making high coverage even more impossible.
